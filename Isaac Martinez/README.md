# NgTodo

This project served as the basis to the 'Getting Started With Angular' presentation during at [Orlando Code Camp 2017](http://www.orlandocodecamp.com/).

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](//github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.  To get to the step by step branches illustrated in the slide deck navigate to [https://github.com/pcalchi/ngtodo](//github.com/pcalchi/ngtodo).

## Requirements

[Node.Js](//nodejs.org/en/).  Download and install.

[Angular CLI](//github.com/angular/angular-cli).  After you've installed Node.Js, run the following at a command prompt `npm i -g @angular/cli`.

[Todo.Core Micro Service](//github.com/pcalchi/Todo.core).  You'll need a running instance of the Todo Micro service as this demo interacts with it.  You can run this within Docker, Kestrel or IIS.

## Running the Code

Simple after cloning the repo, just run `ng serve -o` at a command prompt within you're cloned folder.
